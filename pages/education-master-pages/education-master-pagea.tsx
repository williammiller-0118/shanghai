                                s a soon-to-be expat, one of the most important and difficult decisions you will make is where your child will go to school. While there will be a host of concerns and questions that 
                                arise during your search for a school for your child in Shanghai, generally speaking, international assignees have three main concerns: the safety of their children; the happiness of 
                                their children; and the quality of their children's education.
